 I am a Physics undergraduate (avg. 29.8/30) at the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/en) with research experience spanning dark matter detection (DarkSide, LZ, XENON) and biomechanics data analysis. My technical focus is on applying machine learning to physics research.
 
 Beyond academia, I have developed AI-driven systems in industry—ranging from enterprise chatbots to automated financial decision tools—while contributing to peer-reviewed publications and international hackathons. Deeply motivated by the intersection of Physics and AI, my ambition is to pursue a PhD directly after my bachelor’s.
